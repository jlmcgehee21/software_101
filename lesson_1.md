# How to use your computer (like a software developer)

## Homework
1.  You will need a good text editor (no not microsoft word).  A well-accepted
    open source editor is [Atom](https://atom.io/).  Download and install it. 
    Play around with it a little bit.

2.  I mentioned Atom is **open source**. Read about that 
    [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_software). The first
    paragraph is fine.

3. Download and install [ScreenHero](https://screenhero.com/).  You should have 
   an invitation in your email.  This will allow us to collaborate during
   lessons.

## Lesson "Lecture Points"
1. **Keyboard Shortcuts**
    * Very important for using your computer efficiently.
    * If you do something repeatedly with your mouse, try to find a keyboard
      shortcut for it.
2. **Terminal**
    * This is a way to control your computer with only your keyboard.
    * Almost everything you can do normally on your computer (explore files,
      make files/folders, open applications, etc.) can be done from the
      terminal.

## Lesson Activities
1. Learn some common keyboard shortcuts.  Get familiar with them.
2. Make a project from the terminal.
3. Edit some project files in Atom. Focus on keyboard shortcuts.
